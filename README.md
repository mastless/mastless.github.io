# MASTLESS PHOTOGRAPHY - A Web Dev Exploration

Hello All! Welcome to my Personal Front End Web Dev Site. I will be utilizing Github Pages in order to create the outline of my Photography Website under my business name, Mastless Photography. 

My goal is to not only improve my skills of web development, but also to represent my photography using my own developed design. I will perhaps be pulling from other fellow creator's github's, so if I ever do, I will properly represent where I have as well as the purpose why.

Eventually I would love to make this website integrate with some sort of backend management, such as .NET MVC, in order to allow even more creativity to unveil and shine. However, this will be a future endeavor that probably won't be for a good minute.

Anyways, thanks for stopping by! Super excited to take on this project. 



I would like to give a huge shoutout to my friends and family who have inspired me into delving deeper to these studies. Love you all
